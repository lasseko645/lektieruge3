                i *= 10) {              // here i set that after each iteration the control variable will times itself with 10
            date.setTime(i);            // this initially caused me issues because i didt think about using a "for-loop" for this task but the date.settime is set as an interger witch was not la big enough posible number for the task, but here im setting it to our current controll vartiable witch is a long variable witch works fine
            System.out.println(date.toString()); // here i state that each iteration has to print out it current value stored in the control variable
